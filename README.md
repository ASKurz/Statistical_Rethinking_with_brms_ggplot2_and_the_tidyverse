I love McElreath's [*Statistical rethinking* text](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). However, I've come to prefer using Bürkner’s [brms package](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) when doing Bayesian regression in R. [It's just spectacular](https://andrewgelman.com/2017/01/10/r-packages-interfacing-stan-brms/). I also prefer plotting with Wickham's [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2), and using [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)-style syntax (which you might learn about [here](https://style.tidyverse.org) or [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)).

So, this project is an attempt to reexpress the code in McElreath's textbook. His models are re-fit in brms, plots are reproduced or reimagined with ggplot2, and the general data wrangling code now predominantly follows the tidyverse style.

The current version, 1.3.0, is available in HTML only. However, version 1.0.1 is still available as a [PDF version](https://github.com/ASKurz/Statistical_Rethinking_with_brms_ggplot2_and_the_tidyverse/blob/master/recoding_Statistical_Rethinking_1.0.1_PDF_version.pdf). 

This repository contains the code and text behind the [*Statistical rethinking* with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse](https://bookdown.org/content/3890)
project.

The project was stitched together using Yihui Xie's [bookdown package](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
