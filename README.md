# *Statistical Rethinking* with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse

I love McElreath’s [*Statistical Rethinking* text](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). However, I've come to prefer using Bürkner’s [brms package](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) when doing Bayeisn regression in R. [It's just spectacular](http://andrewgelman.com/2017/01/10/r-packages-interfacing-stan-brms/). I also prefer plotting with Wickham's [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html), and recently converted to using [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)-style syntax (which you might learn about [here](http://style.tidyverse.org) or [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)).

So, this project is an attempt to reexpress the code in McElreath’s textbook. His models are re-fit in brms, plots are reproduced or reimagined with ggplot2, and the general data wrangling code now predominantly follows the tidyverse style.

The first release of the [bookdown version of this project](https://bookdown.org/connect/#/apps/1850/access) is up. I think of it as a 0.9.0-type version. A few helpful readers have pointed out some typos and made some nice code recommendations. Now I’ve have the benefit of a little time, I’ve found some typos and come up with improvements to the code on my own, too. I expect the more-polished 1.0.0 version should be out before the end of the year. In the meantime, constructive criticisms are welcome.

This repository contains the code and text behind the [*Statistical Rethinking* with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse](https://bookdown.org/connect/#/apps/1850/access)
project.

The project was stitched together using Yihui Xie's [bookdown package](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
