# *Statistical Rethinking* with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse

I love McElreath’s [*Statistical Rethinking* text](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). However, I've come to prefer using Bürkner’s [brms package](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) when doing Bayeisn regression in R. [It's just spectacular](http://andrewgelman.com/2017/01/10/r-packages-interfacing-stan-brms/). I also prefer plotting with Wickham's [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html), and recently converted to using [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)-style syntax (which you might learn about [here](http://style.tidyverse.org) or [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)).

So, this project is an attempt to reexpress the code in McElreath’s textbook. His models are re-fit in brms, plots are reproduced or reimagined with ggplot2, and the general data wrangling code now predominantly follows the tidyverse style.

The initial 0.9.0 version of this project was released in bookdown format on September 26, 2018. I released the 1.0.0 update on April 19, 2019. There is still room for improvement and constructive criticisms toward that aim are welcome.

This repository contains the code and text behind the [*Statistical Rethinking* with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse](https://bookdown.org/connect/#/apps/1850/access)
project.

The project was stitched together using Yihui Xie's [bookdown package](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
