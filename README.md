I love McElreath’s [*Statistical Rethinking* text](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). However, I've come to prefer using Bürkner’s [brms package](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) when doing Bayeisn regression in R. [It's just spectacular](http://andrewgelman.com/2017/01/10/r-packages-interfacing-stan-brms/). I also prefer plotting with Wickham's [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html), and recently converted to using [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)-style syntax (which you might learn about [here](http://style.tidyverse.org) or [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)).

So, this project is an attempt to reexpress the code in McElreath’s textbook. His models are re-fit in brms, plots are reproduced or reimagined with ggplot2, and the general data wrangling code now predominantly follows the tidyverse style.

The current version, 1.0.1, marks the addition of a [PDF version](https://github.com/ASKurz/Statistical_Rethinking_with_brms_ggplot2_and_the_tidyverse/blob/master/recoding_Statistical_Rethinking_1.0.1_PDF_version.pdf). There is still room for improvement and constructive criticisms toward that aim are welcome.

This repository contains the code and text behind the [*Statistical Rethinking* with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse](https://bookdown.org/connect/#/apps/1850/access)
project.

The project was stitched together using Yihui Xie's [bookdown package](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
