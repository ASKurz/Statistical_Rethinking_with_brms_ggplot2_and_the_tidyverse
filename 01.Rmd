# The Golem of Prague

![Rabbi Loew and Golem by Mikoláš Aleš, 1899](pictures/Golem_and_Loew.jpg)

I retrieved the picture from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem#/media/File:Golem_and_Loew.jpg).

> Ultimately Judah was forced to destroy the golem, as its combination of extraordinary power with clumsiness eventually led to innocent deaths. Wiping away one letter from the inscription *emet* to spell instead *met*, "death," Rabbi Judah decommissioned the robot. (p. 1)

McElreath left us no code or figures to translate in this chapter. But before you skip off to the next one, why not invest a little time consuming this chapter’s material by watching [McElreath present it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy7Ks3YfbDg&t=14s&frags=pl%2Cwn)? He's an engaging speaker and the material in his online lectures does not entirely overlap with that in the text.
